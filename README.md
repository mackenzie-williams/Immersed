One of its primary focuses is to allow children to develop to the tools and knowledge necessary to navigate the internet safely. Due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide snippets of my code. This repository contains React, .Net, and SQL code.

My role as a software engineer was to display graphs and statistics on the organization administrator dashboard analytics page as well as query the users specific device type. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

* Developed and structured the organization administrator dashboard analytics front-end. 
* Queried the user's device in the front-end and passed that information through the mid-tier to be stored in the back-end.
* Created the necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination.
* Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.
* Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.
* Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap.
* Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team memberâ€™s code.
* Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.
* Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.
* Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality.
* Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks with team members to ensure cohesive implementation of code.
